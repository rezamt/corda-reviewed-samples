# NodeInfo

Allows one to get some rudimentary information about a running Corda node via RPC

Useful for debugging network issues, ensuring flows have loaded etc.

After cloning, use the _getInfo_ gradle task to retrieve node information.

## How to install and run

The node you wish to retrieve information on must already be running. Then do:

    ./gradlew getInfo -Phost="[NODE_RPC_ADDRESS]" -Pusername="[RPC_USERNAME]" -Ppassword="[RPC_PASSWORD]"

For example, to run this utility against Party A defined in the CorDapp Example, you would run:

    ./gradlew getInfo -Phost="localhost:10006" -Pusername="user1" -Ppassword="test"

## Sample Output
  
```
./gradlew getInfo -Phost="localhost:10006" -Pusername="user1" -Ppassword="test"

> Task :getInfo
Logging into localhost:10006 as user1
